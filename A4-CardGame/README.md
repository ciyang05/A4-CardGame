## Reflection

*** In what ways were the use of linked lists particularly appropriate for this assignment? ***

Shakila- It's useful because we are not dealing with card positions and we only care about things like the card after and before. the iteratorAfter method uses a linked list iterator to find that spot cleanly, without indexes, which is exactly what linked lists are good for.

Kiara - The lists were useful because it made moving cards from one pile to another pile a lot more efficient and organized. 

Victoria - Linked lists were so useful to help find, in the cases of my methods, a card faster. I didn't need to find the exact position or the card's index, I could just use the iterator and set it to find that card/mark.

Chiashi - Linked lists were appropriate for this assignment because it made it easier to find a specific card, specifically when using it with an iterator. In addition, you did not have to work about keeping track of indicies.


*** What was the major challenge you faced in completing this assignment? ***

Shakila- writing the methods not using indexes was tricky because I kept thinking in terms of array indexes and also to get the logic right. 

Kiara - One issue I had was figuring out the logic behind the mouse methods since they were a new concept for me. I found it challenging to identify the logic behind the methods and in what order the logic should be performed.

Victoria - The major challenged I faced was understanding the logic for the methods I implemented. I was confused at first on how to work out the logic, but I was able to break it down visually and understand it more  that way.

Chiashi - The major challenge I faced in completing this assignment was the mouse and its methods. This was the first time I utilized a mouse listener in my code, so it was definitely a learning curve. It took me some time to understand the starter code and what the mouse methods were supposed to do.


*** What do you feel you learned from this assignment? ***

Shakila- I learned that iterators aren’t just for looping, they’re also useful for editing linked lists when we need it. The mousePressed method also showed me how user actions like a click connect directly to data structure operations. It’s cool how the GUI and the list work together!

Kiara - I definitely learned more about the iterator and how they are useful especially since linked lists don't have random access. I also learned more about how iterators can modify a list through methods such as remove() and add().

Victoria - I learned how to understand some logic from visuals. Being able to draw stacks, or in this case piles, of cards and where we wanted them to move or what was in them that we wanted to get, was extremely useful! I will definetely keep doing more visual explanations for future assignments!

Chiashi - I learned how to utilize iterators, specifically to add and remove elements. In addition, I learned how a mouse listener worked and how to code the different movements and responses.
