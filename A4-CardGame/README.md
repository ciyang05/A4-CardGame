## Reflection

In what ways were the use of linked lists particularly appropriate for this assignment?
Shakila- It's useful because we are not dealing with card positions and we only care about things like the card after and before. the iteratorAfter method uses a linked list iterator to find that spot cleanly, without indexes, which is exactly what linked lists are good for.

What was the major challenge you faced in completing this assignment?
Shakila- writing the methods not using indexes was tricky because I kept thinking in terms of array indexes and also to get the logic right. 

What do you feel you learned from this assignment?
Shakila- I learned that iterators aren’t just for looping, they’re also useful for editing linked lists when we need it. The mousePressed method also showed me how user actions like a click connect directly to data structure operations. It’s cool how the GUI and the list work together!
