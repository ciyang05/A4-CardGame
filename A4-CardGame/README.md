## Reflection

In what ways were the use of linked lists particularly appropriate for this assignment?
Shakila- It's useful because we are not dealing with card positions and we only care about things like the card after and before. the iteratorAfter method uses a linked list iterator to find that spot cleanly, without indexes, which is exactly what linked lists are good for.

Victoria Reyes Borges - Linked lists were used to be able to find the card, in some cases, really quick instead of getting the position or their index. Being able ot use an iterator felt faster than having to go though each position to find a card.

What was the major challenge you faced in completing this assignment?
Shakila- writing the methods not using indexes was tricky because I kept thinking in terms of array indexes and also to get the logic right. 

Victoria Reyes Borges - The logic for some of the methods I implemented were confusing, causing me to turn to a more visual way of udnerstanding them. 

What do you feel you learned from this assignment?
Shakila- I learned that iterators aren’t just for looping, they’re also useful for editing linked lists when we need it. The mousePressed method also showed me how user actions like a click connect directly to data structure operations. It’s cool how the GUI and the list work together!

Victoria Reyes Borges - I learned how to understand some logic from visuals. Being able to draw stacks, or int hsi case piles, of cards and where we wanted them to move or what was in them that we wanted to get, was extremely useful! I will definetely keep doing more visual explanations for future assignments!
