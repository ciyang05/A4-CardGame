## Reflection

In what ways were the use of linked lists particularly appropriate for this assignment?
Shakila- It's useful because we are not dealing with card positions and we only care about things like the card after and before. the iteratorAfter method uses a linked list iterator to find that spot cleanly, without indexes, which is exactly what linked lists are good for.

Victoria - Linked lists were so useful to help find, in the cases of my methods, a card faster. I didn't need to find the exact position or the card's index, i oculd just use the iterator and set it to find that card/mark.

What was the major challenge you faced in completing this assignment?
Shakila- writing the methods not using indexes was tricky because I kept thinking in terms of array indexes and also to get the logic right. 

Victoria - The major challenged I faced was understanding the logic for the methods I implemented. I was confused at first on how to work out the logic, but I was able to break it down visually and understand it more  that way.


What do you feel you learned from this assignment?
Shakila- I learned that iterators aren’t just for looping, they’re also useful for editing linked lists when we need it. The mousePressed method also showed me how user actions like a click connect directly to data structure operations. It’s cool how the GUI and the list work together!

Kiara - I definitely learned more about the iterator and how they are useful especially since linked lists don't have random access. I also learned more about how iterators can modify a list through methods such as remove() and add().



Victoria - I learned how to understand some logic from visuals. Being able to draw stacks, or int hsi case piles, of cards and where we wanted them to move or what was in them that we wanted to get, was extremely useful! I will definetely keep doing more visual explanations for future assignments!
